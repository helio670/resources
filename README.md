# Additional Resources

Below are suplementary resources provided in addition to the lecture materials within the courses.


### Coding Transitioning and Help
* [Python Switcher's Guide](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Python+Switchers+Guide):  Help to migrate code from IDL to python.
* [Stack Overflow](http://https://stackoverflow.com/): A useful resource to search for answers (and ask questions if you can't find the answer). Solutions and responses submitted by users are fairly well moderated.  

### Learning Resources
* Jake Van der Plas's excellent learning resource [Python Data Science Handbook](http://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (also available in print version)
* [The official Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/): A one-page site that covers most syntax and structures of the Python 3.x series.
* [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org)
* PyCon Conference Videos:
  * [2018](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ)
  * [2017](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg)

### Practice, practice, practice!!
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): Great practice to help you continue to learn python.  Challenges get more and more 
difficult (and aggravating).  You can compare your (horribly inelegant) solution with others in the community, and learn how experienced programmers were able to tackle the problem.

### GIT and Version Control:
* Making code citable:  https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ describes how to use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to generate a DOI for your code so that people who use your code can cite it. 
* [Git Community Book](http://book.git-scm.com/)
* [Pro Git](http://progit.org/book/)
* [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

### Miscellaneous
* Cloud-Based Jupyter Notebook Services:
  * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) allows you to run python code without having it locally installed, has GPU capabilities.
  * [Microsoft Azure](http://notebooks.azure.com)
  * [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/try)
  * [Binder](http://mybinder.org) which allows one to turn a Git repository into a collection of interactive notebooks.
* Language Specific
  * [Python 2 or 3](http://python-future.org/) also provides a utility to aid in converting Python 2 code to 3 beyond its guide of writing 2/3 compatible code. [Python Clock: The Official Countdown](http://pythonclock.org)
