# Additional Resources
## Coding help
* [Python Switcher's Guide](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Python+Switchers+Guide):  Help to migrate code from IDL to python.

## Learning Resources
* Jake Van der Plas's excellent learning resource [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (also available in print version)

## Practice, practice, practice!!
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): Great practice to help you continue to learn python.  Challenges get more and more 
difficult (and aggravating).  You can compare your (horribly inelegant) solution with others in the community, and learn how experienced programmers were able to tackle the problem.

## Python 2 or 3??

## Misc.
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) allows you to run python code without having it locally installed, has GPU capabilities.
